# INTERPRETERS ARE COOL I PROMISE..... ðŸš€

A repo that is for helping me learn languages. I thought that learning how computers parse and interpret data was a good idea.... I will say that I learned a lot. As part of my computer science journey, I felt that learning what happens under the hood was important, so here we are.

## What I learned so far
- The point of Lexers (Lexical Analysis): Lexers break down raw code into tokens, the first step into transforming code into something a computer can understand.
- Parsing: Creating a tree structure from tokens that defines relationships between each of the elements.
- Creating an evaluator: Turning the structured data into code that can be executed.
- Handling errors: Learning what happens behind the scenes for when an error occurs, and how interpreters can catch and manage them.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ukpabik/interpreters-are-cool.git
cd interpreters-are-cool
```
2. Pick a language you want to see (ex. python):
```bash
cd python
```
3. Run the interpreter of that specific language and start experimenting.

## Contributing
If you have any ideas for improving the current implementations, feel free to fork this repo and submit a PR!
