# KupyInterpreter 🚀

Welcome to **KupyInterpreter** – a passion project born out of sheer enthusiasm to dive deep into the wonders of Python! 

## 📖 About the Project

Building **KupyInterpreter** was fueled by my passion for learning Python from the ground up. By creating an interpreter, I've been able to explore the intricacies of programming languages, parsing techniques, and runtime environments. This project serves not only as a personal learning tool but also as a resource for anyone wanting to understand the processes behind interpreters.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔥 Arithmetic Operations:** Master the basics with addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **📝 Variable Assignments:** Assign and manipulate variables effortlessly using the `=` operator.
- **🔍 Conditional Statements:** Bring your code to life with `if` statements that execute based on dynamic conditions.
- **🔢 Expression Evaluation:** Compute and evaluate arithmetic expressions seamlessly.
- **💬 Interactive REPL:** Dive into real-time coding with our user-friendly Read-Eval-Print Loop.
- **🛡️ Error Handling:** Receive clear and informative error messages to guide your learning process.
- **✅ Unit Testing:** Ensure your code is rock-solid with comprehensive unit tests that validate every feature.

## 🚀 Installation
